# Magic Roadmap

This is a *very rough* approximation of where Magic is headed in future versions.

## 7.6

 - Improved Magic Mobs
   - Boss bar support 
   - Scale difficulty based on players (when spawned)
   - Mob factions
   - Stages, maybe triggers that can reconfigure the mob
   - Additional triggers:
     - entered combat
     - attacked
     - spawned
     - killed player
     - leave combat (??)
     - change target
     - ... explode, teleport - getting very specific now
     
## 7.7

 - Class improvements and additions:
   - Ability to use spellshop without a wand
   - Refactor paths to modify properties directly, rather than using upgrade items  
 - Status effect system for temporary (timed) property changes

## 7.8

 - Ability to apply attribute equations to properties like protection
 - Internal attribute system
   - Including damage reduction
   - Mana bonuses
   - Maybe others, see TODO
   - GUI to view player stats
   - GUI to upgrade attributes
   - Levelling system? 
   - Health, hunger, oxygen, etc modifiers
 
## 7.9

 - First draft of RPG-style configs with a variety of classes to choose from
 - Players may choose one class, and then add more classes as they max out (up to some limit)
 - Ability to progress through elements in bending configs, and become the avatar
