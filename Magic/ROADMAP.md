# Magic Roadmap

This is a *very rough* approximation of where Magic is headed in future versions.

## 7.3

 - Ability to apply attribute equations to properties like protection
 - Custom damage types, for use with Damage action and in protection/weakness/damage bonuses
 - Support for protection/weakness/damage bonuses on magic mobs
 - Status effect system for temporary (timed) property changes

## 7.4

 - Internal attribute system
   - Including damage reduction
   - Mana bonuses
   - Maybe others, see TODO
 
## 7.5

 - First draft of RPG-style configs with a variety of classes to choose from
 - Players may choose one class, and then add more classes as they max out (up to some limit)
 
## 7.6

 - Improved mob and spawner support

## 8.0
 
 - 1.13 support
 - Depending on how much the API changes, it seems likely that this version will *not* be backwards compatible!
