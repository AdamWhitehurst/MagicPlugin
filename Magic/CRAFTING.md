# Wand Crafting

Wands can be crafted on the crafting table using one or more recipes. Recipes are defined in crafting.defaults.yml
and customized via crafting.yml.

If you wish to disable one of the default crafting recipes completely, set "enabled" to false, such as:

apprentice:
  enabled: false

See crafting.defaults.yml for a detailed description on customized crafting recipes.
