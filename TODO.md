# TODO

 - Add materials to random wands, always add a material when needed by a spell
 - Make sure max XP is always at least the highest-costing spell on a wand
 - Fix XP system, use a mana system when wand has XP Regen, store accumulated XP, etc
 - Test dying while the wand inventory is open
 - .. add region message for test world, update docs, .. make new video
 - .. Factions support .. ?
 - ^ Wand override for building material list?
 - randomizing should’t change active spell or material
 - make sure when a spell is removed that a wand still has an active spell
 - Add sound effects
 - Add disarm spell
 - fix spheres at large radii - maybe keep current effect though? Looks cool.
 - Target through doors?
 - zombie/skeleton horses! Different cat breeds / dog collars?
 - somehow broke ALL my wands trading with a villager.. ? (.. changing to creative?)
 - vortex type spells.. singularity, black hole, tornado - fun ideas there.
 - allow alter on entities (wolves, horses, cats, etc)
 - invincibility doesn't protect against magic or lightning?


DONE:

 - grenades/explosion that do no block damage
 - remove chests from destructible (+ build able?) list
 - Make sure bedrock is not destructible
 - Decrease levitate flight speed?
 - add “break blocks” parameter to BoomSpell
 - fix health regeneration with max health (test with some plugin?)
 * Tried this, didn't work... waiting on forum confirmation, but sounds like a bust:
  - Look into using player portal event for the portal spell instead of move event
