# !! IMPORTANT !!
#
# Do not edit this file. It is overwritten by Magic on reload.
#
# If you wish to customize this plugin, edit the "config.yml" file instead.
#
# For more information, see: https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md
#
# ALSO IMPORTANT
#
# Note that configurations are additive- meaning you only need to set what you want to *modify* in your custom configuration.
# leaving other options out will make it easier for you to updated.
#
# I will provide a migration log for each update so you can keep track of any changes you might want to make to your customized
# configurations.
#
# YES, STILL IMPORTANT
#
# The default setup is as follows. If you want to change any of this, you'll have to create a custom configuration (config.yml)
#
# - Wands can be crafted on a crafting table using a blaze rod and nether star
# - Wands can NOT be found in random naturally-spawned chests (block populator disabled by default- enable prior to world generation for best use!)
# - Wands can be upgraded on an enchanting table
# - Wands can be combined on an anvil
# - Wands are indestructible (and will show up on a dynmap)
# - Wands can be purchased in Essentials shops
# - WorldGuard building protection will prevent construction spell use
#
# By default, all players have access to all spells. Which players have access to what spells is only
# limited by how players get access to wands. The default wands generated in chests and on an enchanting/crafting table
# will not get superpowerful, that will be left for admins to control.
#
# Fine-grained spell control can be done with permissions, using a group manager, but this will make a lot of the
# wand behavior a little strange (if players get access to wands with spells they can't cast), and in my opinion
# takes some of the fun out of it. Magic is meant to be a vanilla add-on, and in vanilla MC items are everything.
# So the wand has the power, not the player. Anyway, it's up to you!
#
# There are other options available, disabled by default. Briefly, some include:
#
# - Disabling the wand inventory behavior, favoring right-click-to-cycle
# - Filling wands will all available spells by default (useful with permissions-based control)
# - Change the crafting materials
# - Change the way enchanting and chest populating works (randomization control)
# - Make wands destructible
# - Allow players to keep their wands on death
# - More fine-grained control over general spell behavior
#

#
# LOCALIZATION
#
# Note that ALL in-game text is contained in messages.yml
# If you are only customizing to localize text, you can leave the rest of the configuration files alone.
# Additionally, I would love to collect your localized file, if you'd be so kind as to provide it!
#
# Finally, if you feel like you've got a nice customization, please share it with me. If it fits in with my
# own vision of the plugin, I'll happily put it into the defaults, and then you won't need a custom config anymore :)

# Control wands' "Power" settings
#
# Wands have a power (from 0-1) that will change the effects of many spells:
# - Direct-damage spells (arrow, disintegrate, shrink) will increase their damage
# - "Super" construction spells (the two-click variants) will allow for larger dimension selections
# - Radius-based spells (inferno, storm, blob, blast, arrowrain, mob) will have a larger radius, 
#   generally meaning "more" of whatever they do. Be careful with this one.
# - Additionally, all spells will have a longer range.
# All of these aspects can be controlled individually.
# Be aware that a wand can be "overclocked", meaning it has a power greater than 1. Spell properties
# will continue to scale up. This will never happen naturally, only via the "wand configure" command
# or a wand template with a pre-defined power greater than 1
# 
# There are hard max limits defined for range and radius for this reason.

### Economy Helpers
# These values are used to help create a balanced economy if you plan on selling wands, spells, or upgrades.
# Currently they are only visible on the Magic website, though I plan to incorporate them into the plugin in the near future.
# This will probably appear in the form of a "/magic sell <item>" command. This would work just like "/magic give <item>"
# except it would also give you the "worth" of the item as defined by your economy.

# This may be a simple chat message for balance-based economies (e.g. MSRP: $1,000), or it may
# give you physical items for an item-based economy. See the "worth_items" section below.

# The following modifiers affect wand pricing.
# A wand's price is calculated using the sum of the prices of all of its spells as a base.
# Wand properties  (mana, protection, etc) may also add value.
# Each of these values is multiplied by the wand property. Keep in mind that most properties naturally scale
# from 0-1, with some exceptions like mana regeneration and limits. Refer to the maximums set above (e.g. max_mana)
# for a good idea of how those values are going to scale.

# These numbers may look a little screwy,
# I was going for a base-2 kind of thing to hopefully make
# costs fall along even item stack limits. (64)

# A wand may have additional value for each brush it contains

# This will be used as a base multiplier for all values. Once spells and wand properties are balanced relative

# items relative to the rest of your economy.

# By default the Magic ecnonomy is set up for a physical, item-based ecnonomy. I have chosen to use a tiered
# set of items: emerald, diamond, gold_nugget.
# I did some research into various economies- looked at MC item distribution statistics, Essentials' item db valuations,
# anything I could find. I think this may over-value emeralds given the variable of Villager trading, but
# I figure there are plugins that can re-balance that if you wish.
# Other than via trading, emeralds are incredibly rare so I feel like is a good choice for the "top tier" currency.
# I've tried to balance them against diamonds and gold in a natural way, but also in a way that will hopefully result
# in item prices that stack well.
#
# This setup will work very well with the Shopkeepers plugin, or any other item-based trading shop. It could also
# be used as a basis for player trading of wands, spells, and items.
#
# This could also be used to help facilitate dtlTraders setup. Change the values below to the respective amounts
# of cobblestone/stone/wood that dtlTraders uses as currency icons, and (eventually..) Magic will be able to
# give you the proper amounts of each to set up the price of your item in the Trader, using the in-game menu.
