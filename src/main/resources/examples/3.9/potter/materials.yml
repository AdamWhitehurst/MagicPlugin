# Which materials are always considered indestructible.
# No spell will ever modify a block of this type.
# (The exception being accidental destruction via explosion or
# removal of attached block)
indestructible:
- chest

prevent_passthrough:
- bedrock

# Which materials are always completely off-limits.
# Any spells not on this list can not be copied, cloned, replicated
# or otherwise built with using a Wand brush.
# Note that ender_portal blocks can horribly lag the server and client, keep that one on here.
# Mob spawners seem gitchy on removal and leave a perma-effect
# Copying command blocks can be dangerous and cause unintended effects
# It's a good idea to put any indestructibles in here, since they can't be removed.
