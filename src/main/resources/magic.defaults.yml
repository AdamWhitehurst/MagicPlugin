#
# !! IMPORTANT !!
#
# Do not edit this file. It is overwritten by Magic on reload.
#
# If you wish to customize this plugin, copy the "*.defaults.yml" file to "*.yml" and edit the new one.
#
# For instance, copy "magic.defaults.yml" to "magic.yml", and then edit magic.yml.
#
# ALSO IMPORTANT
#
# Note that once you have customized your configuration, it will be more difficult to get updates.
# I will provide migration instructions in the changelog, and make an effort (post-release) to ensure
# that updates won't break existing configurations.
#
# However, if you don't pay attention to the changelog notes on update, you may miss out on new spells, features
# or wands. This can usually be resolved easily using the github diffs (which I will try to link to when appropriate)
# adding in whatever is missing to your customized configuration.
#
# YES, STILL IMPORTANT
#
# The default setup is as follows. If you want to change any of this, you'll have to create a custom configuration (magic.yml)
#
# - Wands can be crafted on a crafting table using a blaze rod and nether star
# - Wands can be found in random naturally-spawned chests
# - Wands can be upgraded on an enchanting table
# - Wands can be combined on an anvil
# - Wands are indestructible (and will show up on a dynmap)
#
# By default, all players have access to all spells. Which players have access to what spells is only
# limited by how players get access to wands. The default wands generated in chests and on an enchanting/crafting table
# will not get superpowerful, that will be left for admins to control.
#
# Fine-grained spell control can be done with permissions, using a group manager, but this will make a lot of the
# wand behavior a little strange (if players get access to wands with spells they can't cast), and in my opinion
# takes some of the fun out of it. Magic is meant to be a vanilla add-on, and in vanilla MC items are everything.
# So the wand has the power, not the player. Anyway, it's up to you!
#
# There are other options available, disabled by default. Briefly, some include:
#
# - Disabling the wand inventory behavior, favoring right-click-to-cycle
# - Filling wands will all available spells by default (useful with permissions-based control)
# - Change the crafting materials
# - Change the way enchanting and chest populating works (randomization control)
# - Make wands destructible
# - Allow players to keep their wands on death
# - More fine-grained control over general spell behavior
#

# LOCALIZATION
#
# Note that ALL in-game text is contained in messages.yml
# If you are only customizing to localize text, you can leave the rest of the configuration files alone.
# Additionally, I would love to collect your localized file, if you'd be so kind as to provide it!
#
# Finally, if you feel like you've got a nice customization, please share it with me. If it fits in with my
# own vision of the plugin, I'll happily put it into the defaults, and then you won't need a custom config anymore :)
